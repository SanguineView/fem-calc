# Frontend Mentor - Tip calculator app

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Looking to get into React, need to get back to basics though.  This was a fun project for JavaScript work which I desperately need.  I've always been able to rig things together with google, but I need to actually know how to do stuff.  This is one of the first JavaScript projects I've completed so it feels good to get the first step started.  CSS wise I'm pretty confident in my skill set, but this was perfect to learn something new.  In this case, I got to work with focus-within which is something I've never used before.  Looking forward to the next project.
